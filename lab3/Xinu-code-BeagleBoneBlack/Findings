Why are these optimization useful?
So there will be less wasted space
 What use cases are there that demonstrate the purpose of the optimizations?
 When lots of multiple sizes are requires
 What other optimizations can be made to improve the efficiency of memory allocation?
Make several memlists so iteration can be faster.
