From my observation, type and kernelprint, which use functions putc and kprintf, prints As, Bs and Cs in different length; 
kerneltype and print, which use functions kputc and uprintf, prints As, Bs and Cs equally. 
These differences are caused because kputc and uprintf has interrupt mask disabled in the begining and then restored before return.
Everytime a process is running, I decrement number of time slices by 1 and when it reaches 0, simply terminate it.
