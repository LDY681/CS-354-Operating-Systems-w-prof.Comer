1. Your simplistic callback mechanism is inapproprite for a mutli-user system. Think carefully about process ownership in a multi-process and describe the major weakness.
The callback mechanism in this lab requires the receiving process and the callback function to be owned by the same user. Otherwise it will not work properly.

The newly added fields should either be initialized in create() function or reset in kill() function.
